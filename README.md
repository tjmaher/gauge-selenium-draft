# gauge-selenium-draft

My first attempt using [Gauge.org] + [Selenium-Ruby](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Ruby-Bindings), mimicking code from Gauge's example project, [ruby-selenium](https://github.com/getgauge-examples/ruby-selenium) so I can attempt to understand this BDD framework I am encountering for the first time.
